## Overview

It was a very interesting and somewhat complex challenge in my knowledge, involving JavaScript.

### The challenge

The focus was on arrays and element counts.

## My process

In HTML and CSS I had no problem, but in JavaScript I had a little problem, mainly in making notifications decrement when the user clicked on links and profiles.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned more about arrays.

### Continued development

I want to evolve more in JavaScript, focusing on arrays.
